<h1>Class Activation Maps for Custom Dataset</h1>
Class activation maps helps us to find the regions which model is used to differentiate from one class or label to other label.
<h2>Dataset</h2>
I collected CAT IMAGES from 2 different datasets and formulated into a DATASET under single folder. I these images are collected from <em>OXFORD IIIT PET DATASET and MICROSOFT CAT AND DOG DATASET</em>.

<h2>Model</h2>
ResNet50 is used with imagenet weights (includes prediction layer. So, predicted labels are from imagenet). Here training is not required because i included predicted layer. If you need to train your own dataset to find activation features <a href="#">Click Here</a>

<h2>Results</h2>
Here in result we find various regions differentiated with various colors. Red color region features are the features which helps the model to differentiate from each labels.
