<h1>Class Activation Maps</h1>
Class activation maps helps us to find the regions which model is used to differentiate from one class or label to other label.
<h2>Dataset</h2>
I used some CAT IMAGES and formulated into a DATASET. I took these cat images from <em>OXFORD IIIT PET DATASET and MICROSOFT CAT AND DOG DATASET</em>.
<br><b>Note:</b>I used resnet50 and imagenet weights for this model, final prediction layer is not removed.
